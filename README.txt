= [Apple only] workaround for localhost =
**Apple Sign In** service does not work with `localhost`, `http` or IP-only domains, so if you develop on local host, so follow below steps:

**STEP 1**
instead of `localhost` you will need to invent some placeholder domain (anything except `example.com`) e.g. `site.com` and use that domain instead of `localhost` in Apple Redirect-Back urls. Then, to redirect `site.com` to your localhost, use either (A) or (B) choice:
- (A) Use redirection extension (like [this](https://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector) or others) in browser to redirect queries from `site.com` to `localhost`, and then jump to **STEP 2** below.
or
- (B) Add virtual local domain name e.g. `site.com` (except `example.com`) pointing to `127.0.0.1`. See the 1-3 lines about "How to setup virtual host": https://gist.github.com/ttodua/b5f54429c00dad6e052b6ccbda08dcb0#file-readme-md . However, if you are not able to change your wordpress installation domain from `localhost` at this moment, then use this code from **STEP 2**

**STEP 2**
Add this code somewhere (eg. functions.php) to replace the redirect back url for Apple specifically:
`add_filter('siwe_redirect_back_uri', function ($url, $provider) { return ($provider === 'apple' ? 'https://site.com/_AUTH_RESPONSE_SIWE_' : $url); }, 10, 2);`
